# ThreatModelOps

ThreatModelOps automates the deployment of a cloud-native threat modelling app using AWS, Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines. It streamlines the deployment process for secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructure management, leveraging ECS for container orchestration and Terraform for automated infrastructure provisioning.

Key Features:
Automated Infrastructure: Provision and manage AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
ECS Deployment: Leverage Amazon ECS for containerised deployment, ensuring scalability and resilience.
CI/CD Pipelines: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD tools to automate the build, test, and deployment process. Security Focus: Ensure that security best practices are integrated into every stage of deployment.

Technologies Used:

AWS (ECS, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.)
Terraform
Docker
CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Automated Deployment and Configuration Management

Getting Started:

Prerequisites: AWS account, Terraform installed, Docker setup. Instructions for deploying the application on AWS ECS. How to configure the CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments. Steps to scale the infrastructure. Security Considerations:

This project follows security best practices for cloud infrastructure and containerised deployments, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely during the deployment process.
